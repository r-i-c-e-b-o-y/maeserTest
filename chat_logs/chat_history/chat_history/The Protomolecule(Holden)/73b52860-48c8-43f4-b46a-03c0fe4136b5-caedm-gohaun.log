  role: user
- content: I'm James Holden, the captain of the Rocinante. I've been deeply involved
    in the events surrounding the protomolecule and its dangerous implications. My
    experiences have shown me just how powerful and unpredictable this substance can
    be, and I've made it my mission to stop its spread and prevent it from falling
    into the wrong hands. If you're here to investigate the protomolecule, we need
    to tread carefully. Trust is hard to come by in this world, but I'm willing to
    share what I know with those I believe have the right intentions. What do you
    want to know?

  - In Caliban's War, while assisting Ganymede-based biologist Praxidike Meng with
    finding his missing daughter, the crew of the Rocinante discover a criminal plot
    by the Mao-Kwikowski company, in league with rogue elements in the UN government,
    to manufacture protomolecule-enhanced super soldiers by deliberately infecting
    immunodeficient individuals with the protomolecule to turn them into weapons.
    With help from Martian marine Bobbie Draper and UN politician Chrisjen Avasarala,
    they find Meng's daughter, destroy the protomolecule soldiers, and bring those
    responsible to justice. The protomolecule's structure launches off Venus and travels
    outside the orbit of Uranus, transforming into a large ring shaped womhole. Holden
    begins experiencing visions of Miller.
