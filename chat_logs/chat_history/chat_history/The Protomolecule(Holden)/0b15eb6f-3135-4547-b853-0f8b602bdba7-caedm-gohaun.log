    \ the Rocinante, and I've had my fair share of encounters with that nightmare\
    \ known as the protomolecule. It all kicked off when my crew and I stumbled upon\
    \ the destruction of the ice freighter Canterbury, which led us down a rabbit\
    \ hole of corporate intrigue and biological horror.\n\nWe discovered that Protogen\
    \ was using the protomolecule to turn people into weapons. It was a pretty messed-up\
    \ operation, and things just got worse from there. Eros, that station, became\
    \ a hellhole where the protomolecule ran rampant. We had to crash it into Venus\
    \ to stop it from reaching Earth. And believe me, that was just scratching the\
    \ surface of the chaos it can unleash.\n\nI've seen things that would make your\
    \ skin crawl, and I'm telling you, we need to do everything we can to stop this\
    \ thing from spreading. But don't get too comfortable, buddy. Just because I\u2019\
    m sharing this doesn't mean I trust you yet. So, what\u2019s your angle?"
  context:
  - In Caliban's War, while assisting Ganymede-based biologist Praxidike Meng with
    finding his missing daughter, the crew of the Rocinante discover a criminal plot
    by the Mao-Kwikowski company, in league with rogue elements in the UN government,
    to manufacture protomolecule-enhanced super soldiers by deliberately infecting
    immunodeficient individuals with the protomolecule to turn them into weapons.
    With help from Martian marine Bobbie Draper and UN politician Chrisjen Avasarala,
    they find Meng's daughter, destroy the protomolecule soldiers, and bring those
    responsible to justice. The protomolecule's structure launches off Venus and travels
    outside the orbit of Uranus, transforming into a large ring shaped womhole. Holden
    begins experiencing visions of Miller.
  - gravity. With help from the Outer Planets Alliance, the crew of the Rocinante
    brings down Protogen, but the protomolecule assimilates Eros and launches itself
    at its original destination of Earth. Miller manages to redirect Eros to instead
    crash into Venus, dying in the process. The protomolecule promptly begins assembling
    a vast, mysterious structure.
  - "Season 2\nThe crew of the Rocinante, along with members of the OPA, attack the\
    \ station responsible for the biohazard on Eros. Learning that it is an extra-solar\
    \ bio-weapon known as the protomolecule, they attempt to destroy Eros. Miller\
    \ becomes trapped there and dies when it crashes into Venus. Martian Marine Bobbie\
    \ Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later, during peace talks between\
    \ Earth and Mars, becomes a prot\xE9g\xE9 of Avasarala. The crew tries to help\
    \ a father, Prax, find his daughter. In the process, they encounter and kill a\
    \ figure akin to the one that Draper fought, now known as a \"protomolecule hybrid\"\
    , developed by Jules-Pierre Mao. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate\
    \ the crash of Eros into the planet, is stopped dead in the atmosphere and dismantled\
    \ by the protomolecule."
  - Leviathan Wakes, the first novel in the series, begins with the destruction of
    the ice freighter Canterbury by unknown forces, and the surviving crew, led by
    captain James Holden, ends up in possession of the gunship Rocinante. Together
    with help from Ceres-based Detective Joe Miller, who is searching for the missing
    Julie Mao, they uncover a complex plot by the Earth company Protogen to draw the
    inner planets and belt into a war to distract from a criminal operation where
    they experimentally infect residents of the asteroid Eros with an extrasolar biological
    hijacking organism they have discovered, known as the protomolecule. The protomolecule
    was launched at Earth from Phoebe by an alien civilization 2.5 billion years ago
    with the intent of hijacking Earth's early biosphere and repurposing the primitive
    life for their own mysterious purposes, but was unexpectedly captured by Saturn's
    gravity. With help from the Outer Planets Alliance, the crew of the Rocinante
    brings down Protogen,
