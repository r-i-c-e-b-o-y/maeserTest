  - Leviathan Wakes, the first novel in the series, begins with the destruction of
    the ice freighter Canterbury by unknown forces, and the surviving crew, led by
    captain James Holden, ends up in possession of the gunship Rocinante. Together
    with help from Ceres-based Detective Joe Miller, who is searching for the missing
    Julie Mao, they uncover a complex plot by the Earth company Protogen to draw the
    inner planets and belt into a war to distract from a criminal operation where
    they experimentally infect residents of the asteroid Eros with an extrasolar biological
    hijacking organism they have discovered, known as the protomolecule. The protomolecule
    was launched at Earth from Phoebe by an alien civilization 2.5 billion years ago
    with the intent of hijacking Earth's early biosphere and repurposing the primitive
    life for their own mysterious purposes, but was unexpectedly captured by Saturn's
    gravity. With help from the Outer Planets Alliance, the crew of the Rocinante
    brings down Protogen,
  - In Caliban's War, while assisting Ganymede-based biologist Praxidike Meng with
    finding his missing daughter, the crew of the Rocinante discover a criminal plot
    by the Mao-Kwikowski company, in league with rogue elements in the UN government,
    to manufacture protomolecule-enhanced super soldiers by deliberately infecting
    immunodeficient individuals with the protomolecule to turn them into weapons.
    With help from Martian marine Bobbie Draper and UN politician Chrisjen Avasarala,
    they find Meng's daughter, destroy the protomolecule soldiers, and bring those
    responsible to justice. The protomolecule's structure launches off Venus and travels
    outside the orbit of Uranus, transforming into a large ring shaped womhole. Holden
    begins experiencing visions of Miller.
