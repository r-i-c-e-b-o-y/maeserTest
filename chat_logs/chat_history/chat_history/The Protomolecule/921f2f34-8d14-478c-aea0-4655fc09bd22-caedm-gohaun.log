  context:
  - 'Miller''s primary assignment on Ceres station was looking into the

    disappearances of the local organized crime such as the Golden Bough''s, Sohiro''s
    crew, and Loca Greiga. Additionally, when Ariadne and Jules-Pierre Mao wanted
    to find their estranged daughter Julie Mao, who was last known to live on Ceres
    Station, they turned to Star Helix Security, where Jules-Pierre owned shares.
    Captain Shaddid of Star Helix gave Miller the task of tracking down Julie and
    shipping her home to Luna as an off-the-record kidnap job.'
  - "Miller has witnessed a lifetime of the horrible things people will do to each\
    \ other out of greed, anger, lust, and desperation. He stopped trying to stem\
    \ the tide of man\u2019s depravity years ago, and is resigned to surviving as\
    \ best he can. Despite the lack of rainy or sunny days in Ceres' subterranean\
    \ colony, Miller wears a hat in defiance of the anti-Earth sentiments expressed\
    \ by many of his fellow Belters. At the start of the series he has never left\
    \ Ceres. When asked why he has never been in space before Miller replies: \"I'm\
    \ more of a city Belter\".\nHis personality evolves as he investigates the case\
    \ of the missing heiress until he pokes his nose too deep and uncovers sensitive\
    \ information at which point he was fired.\nHaving found a sense of purpose, he\
    \ does not abandon the case. His devotion to the search for Julie Mao turns to\
    \ something even more inspired when he learns her ultimate fate and that of the\

  - 'For weapons Miller is shown to have a preference for revolvers which plays in
    to the ''anachronistic old grizzled cop who has been around forever'' aura that
    he cultivated.

    While on Ceres, Miller is known for his wearing a hat which he facetiously says
    ''keeps the rain off my head'' even though there is no rain on Ceres. He was given
    the hat by his friend Sematimba[1]. After his escape from being kidnapped and
    tortured by Anderson Dawes, he reveals that despite Dawes'' search of his hat,
    it still has the data cube from Julie Mao''s apartment hidden within the inner
    band.'

    Cibola Burn is a book heavily influenced by westerns which tells the story of
    one of the early colony worlds through the Ring Network, Ilus, experiencing a
    confrontation between refugee settlers and the corporation that has been granted
    rights to it. The crew of the Rocinante is sent to mediate the situation, but
    they find that the world''s alien ruins are reawakening. An alien reactor explodes,
    creating an extinction level event on the surface of the planet, and reactivating
    an alien defense network that strands the ships in orbit. Working together to
    survive, the crew of the Rocinante and the settlers overcome the tremendous odds
    stacked against them, and demonstrate the feasibility of extrasolar colonies to
    persevere through disaster.'

  - 'Traveling through Eros, Miller realizes that station is getting its information
    from somewhere such as the location of Earth. He realizes after hearing the station
    talk about the Razorback that the protomolecule is using Julie Mao. He then opens
    up a channel to Holden. He tells Holden to call off the UN nukes and that he can
    negotiate with Julie and convince her to not attack Earth. Holden refuses but
    agrees to attempt to stall them long enough for Miller to find her.

    After searching for thirty-three hours, Miller finally finds Julie. Her body had
    changed dramatically from the protomolecule but her face stayed somewhat the same
    and she was still breathing. Miller shakes her gently to wake her up. Realizing
    they''ve never actually met Miller introduces himself. He is able to convince
    her to change course to Venus at Holden''s suggestion. As they talk Miller takes
    off his suit and gives himself to Julie and the protomolecule telling her they''ll
    be fine.'
  - gravity. With help from the Outer Planets Alliance, the crew of the Rocinante
    brings down Protogen, but the protomolecule assimilates Eros and launches itself
    at its original destination of Earth. Miller manages to redirect Eros to instead
    crash into Venus, dying in the process. The protomolecule promptly begins assembling
    a vast, mysterious structure.
  - Arriving at asteroid BA-834024112, the crew of the Roci found the Anubis, the
    Protogen ship that had boarded the Scopuli. Aboard the ship they found the bodies
    of the crew in a late stage of protomolecule-infection, a video of Antony Dresden
    explaining Protogen's plans, and communication logs. Upon returning to the Roci,
    Miller attributes UN ships destroying MCRN ships above Mars to Holden's releasing
    of the information of the origin of the stealth ships being from Earth. On their
    trip back to Tycho, Naomi theorizes that the protomolecule wasn't "smart" enough
    and needed more biomass.

  context:
  - En route, the crew discovered that data they brought from the Donnager implicated
    Earth ships in its destruction. Holden immediately broadcast the data to the public,
    like he had done with the information about the Canterbury's destruction. This
    led to a disagreement between Holden and Miller, the former believing that information
    should be free so the public could draw its own conclusions, while the latter
    believed that the public is bound to reach incorrect conclusions and that detective
    work is needed in order to not broadcast potentially false and disastrous accusations.

  - 'Later, Miller is called by the barman of the Blue Frog, Hasini. Dimitri Havelock,
    Miller''s partner was seemingly looking for a fight. Miller arrives at the bar
    and after a conversation with Dimitri the two make their way to another bar, The
    Distinguished Hyacinth Lounge. The partners joined with their coworkers and began
    having a good night when Captain Shaddid contacted all of the security officers
    in the bar and briefed them on the message James Holden released after the Canterbury''s
    destruction.

    Afraid that the OPA agents on Ceres would seize the opportunity to incite a riot,
    Star Helix set armed forces to patrol the station, armed with SWAT gear because
    the riot gear was mysteriously missing. Miller got command of the second team
    to cover sectors thirteen through twenty-four on port level, where he successfully
    broke up a mob by ordering his team to shoot the instigator in the legs.'

  - Holden and his crew of the Rocinante had in the meantime been invited to the safety
    of the OPA's headquarters on Tycho Station by Fred Johnson. While there, Johnson
    received a distress call from Eros, originating from a crewmember of the Scopuli.
    The Rocinante was disguised as a gas freighter and sent to Eros to investigate.
    With the help of his former partner Havelock, Miller tracked the ship there and,
    still set to find Julie, spent some of his last money to take the Belt Transit
    Ferry to Eros.
  - In Caliban's War, while assisting Ganymede-based biologist Praxidike Meng with
    finding his missing daughter, the crew of the Rocinante discover a criminal plot
    by the Mao-Kwikowski company, in league with rogue elements in the UN government,
    to manufacture protomolecule-enhanced super soldiers by deliberately infecting
    immunodeficient individuals with the protomolecule to turn them into weapons.
    With help from Martian marine Bobbie Draper and UN politician Chrisjen Avasarala,
    they find Meng's daughter, destroy the protomolecule soldiers, and bring those
    responsible to justice. The protomolecule's structure launches off Venus and travels
    outside the orbit of Uranus, transforming into a large ring shaped womhole. Holden
    begins experiencing visions of Miller.

    Do you want to be the ass or the boot?\" They both became cops. Miller now works\

    \ for Ceres. Choosing to work for Star Helix meant working for Earth \u2013 the\

    \ side.\nHis friend and partner Sematimba got 'kicked off the force' and gave\

    \nHis role as a cop serving an Earth-based corporation often put him at odds with\
    \ the Belter inhabitants who consider him a traitor to his people."
