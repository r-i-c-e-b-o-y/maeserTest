  context:
  - 'Laconia Arc

    In Persepolis Rising, set three decades after the Free Navy was defeated, the
    Laconians reemerge out of their gate with advanced, protomolecule-powered technology,
    including three incredibly powerful dreadnought battleships. Duarte has also been
    using the protomolecule on himself to make himself essentially immortal. The Laconians
    easily take control of the Slow Zone and the solar system, controlling the hub
    between worlds and creating a vast empire under Duarte''s rule. The Rocinante
    crew becomes part of the resistance movement on Medina Station in the Slow Zone
    and successfully manages to stage a revolt that allows them to escape to the various
    colony worlds. Holden is captured, but the remaining crew of the Rocinante scatters.'
  - In Tiamat's Wrath, Duarte attempts to attack the creatures that sometimes consume
    ships traveling between gates, which are realized to be the same forces that killed
    the protomolecule's creators. This backfires, leading to attacks on all of humanity
    by these "dark gods." One such attack leaves Duarte catatonic and the empire in
    disarray. Meanwhile, the fractured crew of the Rocinante successfully destroy
    the Laconian dreadnought in the Sol system and a dark god attack decimates all
    ships in the Slow Zone, including the second dreadnought. Realizing they will
    never have a better chance to destroy the Laconian empire, the crew of the Rocinante
    lead a massive siege of the Laconian system by the resistance forces and successfully
    destroy the alien construction platforms that allowed Laconia to build their advanced
    technology, in addition to recovering Holden.
  - 'Series overview

    Setting

    Hundreds of years in the future, humanity has colonized the Solar System. The
    three largest powers are the United Nations of Earth and Luna, the Martian Congressional
    Republic on Mars, and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a loose political confederation
    of colonies scattered across the asteroid belt and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
    The United Nations is a militaristic, ultra-capitalist society with authoritarian
    undertones, while the Martians have evolved into a corporatist culture. Both ruthlessly
    exploit and oppress the "Belter" populations of the OPA to gain control of their
    valuable natural resources.'
  - In Caliban's War, while assisting Ganymede-based biologist Praxidike Meng with
    finding his missing daughter, the crew of the Rocinante discover a criminal plot
    by the Mao-Kwikowski company, in league with rogue elements in the UN government,
    to manufacture protomolecule-enhanced super soldiers by deliberately infecting
    immunodeficient individuals with the protomolecule to turn them into weapons.
    With help from Martian marine Bobbie Draper and UN politician Chrisjen Avasarala,
    they find Meng's daughter, destroy the protomolecule soldiers, and bring those
    responsible to justice. The protomolecule's structure launches off Venus and travels
    outside the orbit of Uranus, transforming into a large ring shaped womhole. Holden
    begins experiencing visions of Miller.

  context:
  - Miller and Holden decided to investigate the situation while the rest of the crew
    hid. Forcing a CPM security officer to open one of the already full radiation
    shelters, they discovered that all the refugees had been gassed unconscious, and
    that there was heavy radiation inside, but not before they both got dosed by a
    heavy dose of radiation themselves. With only hours to live, they managed to shoot
    their way through the security forces and the infected people from the radiation
    shelters who were turning into "vomit zombies", and escape to the Rocinante. With
    radiation sickness, a gunshot wound and a broken arm, Miller barely survived,
    lying in the sick bay with Holden for several days while the Rocinante travelled
    to the location of the asteroid Julie had written down.
  - The first time Miller killed anyone was in his third year working security. He'd
    been twenty-two, just married, talking about having kids. The call had been from
    an illegal restaurant almost at the mass center. It happened fast. The perp had
    come out of the hole with a gun in one hand, dragging a woman by the hair with
    the other. Miller's partner, a ten year veteran named Carson, had shouted out
    the warning. The perp had turned, swinging the gun out at arms length like a stuntman
    in a video. Killing another human was supposed to be hard. The gun came around;
    the gunman dropped the woman and shouted. It turned out that, for Miller at least,
    it wasn't that hard.

  - When the Martian ship the Donnager was destroyed, the United Nations withdrew
    from governing Ceres, assuming the Belt was the culprit. Shaddid, now responsible
    of keeping the peace while the local government transferred its power to the OPA,
    felt she couldn't trust Miller, and fired him. Dawes had, however, divulged the
    fact that Holden had been on the Donnager and survived. Before Miller lost his
    access codes, he managed to query the docking logs for ships that plausibly could
    have escaped the Donnager, looking for the ship that had carried Holden off.
