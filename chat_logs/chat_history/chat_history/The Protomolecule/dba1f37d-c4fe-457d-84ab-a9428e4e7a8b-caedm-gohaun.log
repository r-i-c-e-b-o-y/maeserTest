  - "Biography Background An orphan, born and raised on Ceres Station in the Asteroid\
    \ Belt, Miller and his fellow orphan Sematimba grew up in a life of petty crime\
    \ just to survive. As they became adults, Semi planted this question in him, \"\
    Do you want to be the ass or the boot?\" They both became cops. Miller now works\
    \ as a detective with Star Helix Security, an Earth corp with the security contract\
    \ for Ceres. Choosing to work for Star Helix meant working for Earth \u2013 the\
    \ oppressors of Belters like himself \u2013 but at least it put him on the winning\
    \ side.\nHis friend and partner Sematimba got 'kicked off the force' and gave\
    \ Miller his signature hat to remind him \"not to lose your head like I did.\"\
    \nHis role as a cop serving an Earth-based corporation often put him at odds with\
    \ the Belter inhabitants who consider him a traitor to his people."
  - 'Josephus "Joe" Aloisus Miller was a hardened, world-weary detective originating
    from Ceres, working for Star Helix Security. He developed a love-interest in OPA
    operative Julie Mao after being assigned a case involving her disappearance, and
    would eventually play an integral role in saving Earth from the Protomolecule
    after it took control of Eros.

    Personality Hard-working, grizzled, and a bit of an alcoholic, he was dedicated
    to getting by. He knew the system was rigged, and always had been. He just wanted
    a decent cut of it. He took pay-offs when he could and made arrests when he had
    to. He was perceived by his leadership and peers as unmotivated and was routinely
    assigned the least urgent duties as well as any assignments for which lack of
    results was preferred.'
  - He is quite a cynical guy with a dark sense of humor. But something happens to
    him during the search for Julie Mao; he responds to the personality he is learning
    about. She moves him deeply, It is mentioned that he has "Laura" syndrome -- a
    detective falls in love with a victim whose murder they're investigating -- and
    it may be true, but Miller doesn't care what people think about it. He is determined
    to find her and eventually we see that indeed he loves her.
